# Workflow Research
The following are features of the intended development workflow

- Sprint X planning with trello
- Pick a task
- Work on userguide/UI before it is implemented  
- Work on TDD and design how it will be implemented
  - Ok to work on more tasks if dependancies occur for the chosen task, or if it will simplfy design later down the road.
- Tag trello card with TDD spec #
- Complete feature, commit to git, and like trello card to git commit, record time taken.
